# RSUBasedSecurityForPlatooning_Demo

## 1. A 4-Vehicle Platoon
The video below demonstrates a simulation of a platoon consisting of 4 vehicles crusing along a 4 lane highway using DSRC communication protocol and equipped with CACC controller. The setup consists of SUMO and OMNeT++ simulators. SUMO is an open source road traffic simulator that models and visuializes road traffic in uban scenario. OMNeT++ is a network simulator that contains the necessary network protocol libraries for wireless communication. Additionally, for cooperative driving such as platooning using the DSRC communication, we use Veins and Plexe libraries for OMNeT++.
